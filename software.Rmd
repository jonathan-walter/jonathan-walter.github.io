We develop novel or improved statistical analysis tools and computational models and provide these as open-source software packages. Please note that, while we make good-faith attempts to ensure this software is robust and bug-free, we do sometimes find bugs and unexpected behavior, especially when applying them to contexts outside of the research needs for which they were originally developed. If you find a bug, please report it to the contact listed on the package webpage or to Jon at jawalter@ucdavis.edu.
