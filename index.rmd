<p align="left">The Walter Lab at the UC Davis Center for Watershed Sciences uses quantitative, computational, and data-intensive science to strengthen fundamental understandings of environmental systems, and to enable wiser conservation and natural resource management decisions. Broadly, we are interested in the stability and resilience of environmental systems and how to manage systems to promote their health and function in the face of environmental change. We work mainly in aquatic (e.g., lake, stream, river, estuary, and coastal ocean) habitats and at organizational levels from individual behavior to ensembles of ecosystems. As ecologists, we focus on the living components of natural systems, and collaborate with physical scientists, engineers, and legal scholars to produce more holistic and impactful science.</p>
